    <title>Software Design Model</title>

    <para>
      &project; is developed essentially in an
      <glossterm>agile</glossterm> model.  At &Ig2m;, &project;
      has not adopted any formal <glossterm>process model</glossterm>
      for development<remark><
      <footnote>
        <para>and well, the &project; project does not have a
        large development team, at this revision</para>
      </footnote></remark>. In a broad sense, the development
      model &mdash; as developed, reflectively, in the development of
      &project; &mdash; may largely resemble a
      <productname>Scrum</productname> development model, if any other 
      generic <productname>agile</productname> model. 
    </para>
    <para>
      Similar to <productname>Scrum</productname>, &project; is
      developed in each of a momentary <glossterm>sprint</glossterm>. 
      Unlike <productname>Scrum</productname>, however, the
      <glossterm>sprint</glossterm> duration is not preceded with any
      manner of a <emphasis>planning session</emphasis>, and is not
      followed with any manner of formal
      <glossterm>review</glossterm>, excepting &mdash; in the latter
      regards &mdash; a manner of a practical <emphasis>review by
      application</emphasis><remark>
      <footnote>
        <para>
          i.e. a certain manner of a <foreignphrase>Trial by
          Fire</foreignphrase> approach to <glossterm>bug
          hunting</glossterm> and <glossterm>design
          review</glossterm>, in software development.
        </para>
      </footnote>
      </remark>. Certainly, the <foreignphrase>ad
      hoc</foreignphrase> <glossterm>agile</glossterm>
      methodology developed in &project; may not be suitable for
    <emphasis>large scale</emphasis> projects. However, it appears to
    be sufficient for a manner of <emphasis>small scale</emphasis>,
    <glossterm>modular development</glossterm>, even at a
    <emphasis>scale</emphasis> of a <glossterm>developer
    team</glossterm> comprised  essentially of an individual
    <glossterm>developer</glossterm>.

      <title>"Lessons from Camptown" &mdash; Concerning Alignment 
      Between Design and Application in a Sprint-Oriented
      Development Model</title>

      <para>The &project; was begun essentially as a prototype for
       a system for mathematical computations. As a summary of the
       first set of goals addressed in the &project; project: The
       primary goal was to  develop an
       <glossterm>object system</glossterm> for
       <glossterm>measurement</glossterm> values, in a model for
       <glossterm>dispatched</glossterm> application of
       <glossterm>monadic</glossterm>, <glossterm>diadic</glossterm>,
       and <glossterm>variadic</glossterm> mathematical
       <glossterm>operations</glossterm> &mdash; the latter,
       esentially as to extend of <glossterm>functions</glossterm>
       implemented for mathematical <glossterm>operations</glossterm>
       in &cltl;. </para>

       <para>As secondary goals, it was estimated that a
       graphical <glossterm>presentation</glossterm> model may be
       developed for such an <glossterm>object system</glossterm> as
       would be addressed in the previous goals. It was esimated that
       such a graphical <glossterm>presentation</glossterm> model may be
       developed specifically onto &clim;. By extension, it was a
       secondary goal: To develop a graphical model 
       for <glossterm>phasor</glossterm> analysis and other
       <glossterm>signal domain</glossterm> analysis, such that could
       be applied &mdash; specifically &mdash; in an endeavor to
       clarify some concepts as with regards to qualities of
       <glossterm>electrodynamically reactive</glossterm> electrical
       circuit elements and their applications within circuits of
       <glossterm>alternating current</glossterm>. In this set
       of those goals, perhaps that much of the design of &project;
       may be subsequently revised as towards applications of
       technologies for <glossterm>pulse width modulation</glossterm> 
       within <glossterm>digital signaling</glossterm> systems.
       Concerning a question of the essential
       <glossterm>geometry</glossterm> of
       <glossterm>electrodynamically reactive</glossterm> circuits 
       within <glossterm>alternating current</glossterm> systems
       &mdash; perhaps that may remain to be addressed, as towards an
       application of this system, extensionally, for
       <glossterm>modeling</glossterm> of <glossterm>numeric 
       systems</glossterm> in relation to
       <glossterm>components</glossterm> of <glossterm>electrical
       systems</glossterm>, as for purposes of electronic design
       and electrical system diagnostics.
      </para>

      <para>
        That secondary set of goals would prove to  be largely
        orthogonal to the primary set of goals, as addressed in the
        development of the &project; <glossterm>codebase</glossterm>.
      </para>

      <section>
        <title>The First Sprints: &Ig1m;</title>

        <para>
          It might be estimated: That there cannot be a work developed 
          of the sciences, except that it would be a work developed in
          extension of <emphasis>existing work</emphasis>, insofar as
          of theories and practices developed in domains of
          scientific discourse and the practical applications of
          scientific theory.<remark>
          <footnote>
            <para>
              This comment, itself, perhaps extends of
              Isaac Newton's original juxtaposition of
              <glossterm>geometry</glossterm> and
              <glossterm>mechanics</glossterm> &mdash; broadly,
              towards a contrast of <emphasis>ideal
              systems</emphasis> and <emphasis>material
              systems</emphasis>, in science and engineering.
            </para>
          </footnote></remark>. Likewise, the design of &project; was
          begun after a review of <emphasis>existing work</emphasis>,
          namely as with regards to repersentations of meaurement
          values within computational systems. This article will avoid
          any length dissertation about the development of
          <productname><acronym>XML</acronym></productname> and its
          origins in
          <productname><acronym>SGML</acronym></productname>. With
          regards to
